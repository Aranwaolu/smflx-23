                <p>1. Man was made a living soul at creation but after the fall, obedience to unrighteousness reduced man to corrupted flesh. Noah was a righteous man; a just man is a righteous man. The righteousness of Noah was a type of the righteousness of the Lord God (Lord Almighty). (Romans 1:19, Hebrews 11:7).
                    <br><br> 2. In the everlasting dimension, there are three operations of God in different strengths. The revelation of God per time is dependent on the strength of light being shown.
                    <br><br> 3. The highest strength is God, as seen in Genesis 1- the head region (which is the 100 fold of the everlasting), then the Lord God, as seen in Genesis 2 and 3 (60 fold of the everlasting), and thirdly, from Genesis 
                    <br><br>4. as man continued to reduce in stature God began to reveal Himself as the Lord (30 fold of the everlasting). 4. The thought of the creation of man in the image and likeness of God is a thought that sprang from the peak of the everlasting dimension of God. The creation of man’s spirit and soul was the operation of the Godhead but the fashioning of man’s body was an operation of the Lord God. (Genesis 1:26, Genesis 2:7).
                    <br><br> 5. After the fall, man could no longer relate with God on the pedestal of the Lord God as he experienced a dive into flesh. Hence, God began to relate with him as the Lord. At this point, man began to depreciate until the thoughts and imaginations of his heart became only evil continually which generated wicked ways in him. (Genesis 6:3)
                    <br><br> 6. Flesh is a product of unrighteousness. Unrighteousness is wickedness; a man’s wickedness is seen in his ways. (Isaiah 55:7, Genesis 6:3-5, Romans 1:19).
                    <br><br> 7. Man further depreciated from the state of flesh (unrighteousness) into ungodliness. Ungodliness is a state of weakness which man fell into. An unrighteous man is flesh with little strength, but ungodliness is a weakened state of flesh without strength. God in His mercy weakened unrighteousness to become ungodly so that man can be redeemed. (Romans 5:6).
                    <br><br> 8. The law of Christ can remit the sin of an ungodly man but not an unrighteous man. An unrighteous man requires a manifestation of the Son of God (Jesus the righteous) for his sins to be remitted. An ungodly man is without strength hence, he can go through the faith program for the formation of Christ. (Romans 5:6, 1 John 2:1-2).
                    <br><br> 9. Jesus the righteous is the bearer of the incorruptible seed; within His gene are substances that would make an unrighteous man to cease from his sins. The incorruptible seed is the seed of the kingdom of heaven.
                    <br><br> 10. The revelation of faith is a component of the mystery of godliness which has the capacity to open the eyes of a believer, turn him from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God. Faith is a thought, standard, parameter, and principle of life. (Acts 26:18). 
                    <br><br>11. Unrighteous thoughts are higher than the principles of faith; men such as Nimrod were unrighteous men. Such men possess a wisdom with which they turn men away from God. 
                    <br><br>12. An ungodly man is fashioned by the course of this world which raises children while an unrighteous man is both fashioned and programmed by the prince of the power of the air which raises sons of perdition. (Ephesians 2:1-2).
                    <br><br> 13. Apostle Paul admonished the Corinthians that their faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. This means that the power of God is able to deal with the wisdom of men. The power of God is the gospel of Christ and the operation of faith. (1 Corinthians 2:5, 1 Peter 1:5).
                    <br><br> 14. Faith is the ability to see the unseen; it is the ability to see hope. To see God, one must have a pure heart. Hence the first thing we must possess before we can see God is hope. (Hebrews 11:1).
                    <br><br> 15. By faith Enoch walked with God until he was no more. For a man to see God, he must be ‘no more’. This means that everything of man and earth have been expired in him in their entirety. To attain such estate, we must carry our cross and die daily. (Hebrews 11:5, Galatians 2:20, Genesis 5:24).
                    <br><br> 16. A man that is no more is him who is able to see hope; such a man is no longer living according to the course of the world. A man that is alive to the world is veiled from seeing hope. The veil which hinders men from seeing hope is in the mind and thoughts. A man in hope is able to rejoice in seeing God.
                    <br><br> 17. The faith of the Son of God is everlasting in nature. In physics, the law of inertia states that an object would remain in a state of rest unless acted upon by an external force. Likewise, it takes the faith of the Son of God which is a higher force to deliver a man from ungodliness. But this is not the end of the faith of the Son.
                    <br><br> 18. The faith of the Son of God is intended to deliver salvation to us and to bring us to see the glory of God. To see the glory of God is to come to the knowledge of God which is everlasting life.
                    <br><br> 19. We find access by faith into grace. This is the grace of God that delivers to us the inheritance and the promise, which is the end of the journey. It is the grace wherein we stand but one cannot stand without having walked. (Romans 5:1-2).
                    <br><br> 20. Standing is the end of Christ formation; faith is the program for the formation of Christ in a man. A carnal Christian is seated in the region of darkness, thus, it would take the preaching of faith to move him from such a position. (Psalm 1:5). 
                    <br><br>21. The seat of the scornful is a seat for unbelievers, yet there are believers who sit there. The scornful have a standard of righteousness with which they judge.
                    <br><br> 22. A believer who is still walking in ungodliness is characterized as a scoffer, but as he begins to deny lusts, he would be unseated from the seat of the scornful. (2 Peter 3:3-4). 
                    <br><br>23. Lusts are desires which are not of God. To walk in lust is to give expression to those desires. (James 1:14).
                    <br><br> 24. One who is not standing cannot participate in a higher fellowship. Joshua the high priest was standing at the door of the most holy yet he had a filthy garment. Thus, his garments had to be changed before he could be given a place to walk. (Ephesians 6:13-14, Zechariah 3:3-4).
                    <br><br> 25. Between the veil of the most holy and the ark are paths which signify everlasting works. These paths are the everlasting courts: incorruptible, undefiled and unfading. The contents of the ark are the promises for overcomers; the ark is an eternal word. The everlasting works are the ways which Joshua had to walk through. (Zechariah 3:6-7).
                    <br><br> 26. There are different garments worn by priests. The priests wore two garments but the high priests wore multiple garments: a garment of praise for entrance, a garment of salvation, and a garment of vengeance. (Isaiah 59:17).
                    <br><br> 27. The armors of God are garments of salvation. One must put on garments which are incorruptible, undefiled and unfading to not be found naked. The Laodicean church had not completed their walk, hence they were found naked. (Isaiah 61:10).
                    <br><br> 28. A man that can see the hope of the glory of God must have finished the curriculum of Christ, the mystery of godliness. It is the formation of Christ within a man that qualifies him to stand in the grace that can hope for the glory of God. (Colossians 1:26-27, Romans 5:2).
                    <br><br> 29. Strength is a working of laws; an unrighteous man has strength by reason of the thoughts and imaginations of his heart. Nimrod was a man of strength who rose up after the flood. He gathered men from the mount of Ararat where the ark rested after the flood and moved them to the plains by this strength. (1 Corinthians 15:55-56, Genesis 11:2-5).
                    <br><br> 30. Unrighteousness is the strength to go against God’s thought of man from the beginning. Truth is not fact but the original thought God had in His mind in the beginning. The truth of God should be obeyed and not resisted. Man ought not to fight against truth. One can turn the truth of God to a lie; the thoughts and imaginations of one's heart can cause one to hold the truth of God in unrighteousness. (Romans 1:18-19).
                    <br><br> 31. Sarah sojourned with Abraham by truth, thus, she was able to call him lord and agreed to be called his sister. One culture of a people who are living by truth is that they live having all things in common; esteeming one another better than themselves. (1 Peter 3:6, Philippians 2:3).
                    <br><br> 32. In one of the parables of Jesus, a pharisee and a publican came to the temple to pray but the pharisee judged himself righteous as a result of the thoughts and imaginations of the heart. Hence, he went away not justified unlike the publican who acknowledged his unrighteous state. (Luke 18:10-12). 
                    <br><br>33. Our Lord Jesus is both faithful and true. Truth ought to be in our inward parts and can only move from our minds to our inward parts as we walk in them. 
                    <br><br> 34. Faithfulness is a state of incorruptibility. A faithful man has broken his covenant with lies; truth has been moved into his inward parts. Thus, he becomes a faithful witness who cannot lie. (Psalm 51, 1 Corinthian 4:3-4).
                    <br><br> 35. No matter how much we have obeyed God, we must never judge ourselves. Our Lord Jesus, gave the standard for us to judge ourselves, that having done all righteousness we must acknowledge we are just unprofitable servants doing our duties. (1 Corinthians 4: 3-5, Luke 17:10). 
                    <br><br>36. We must not have the attitude of one that assumes that he has righteousness because he has obeyed God, this is a product of unrighteousness, rather we must wait for the Lord to come and judge us. The parameter for God's judgment is truth. 
                    <br><br>37. Unrighteousness is not an obvious sin that people see. The sin of the men in Genesis are unrighteous sins because they held truth in unrighteousness. The purpose of truth is to expunge unrighteousness from the soul, thoughts and imaginations. (Romans 1:18-19).
                    <br><br> 38. Unrighteousness corrupts truth and anything offered from it is an abomination. The strength of corruption is unrighteousness, thus, to heal men from corruption is to heal them from unrighteousness. 
                    <br><br>39. An unrighteous man interprets the truth to fit his thoughts, 
                    imaginations and ways. God conditions us to deal with unrighteousness in us. The truth of God provides the template on how we must live to please the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 2:9-10). 
                    <br><br>40. Another word for unrighteousness is lies which are a product of the covenant with hell and death. If unrighteousness is not addressed, it calls for the vengeance of God. (Romans 5:7; 3:5-7, Isaiah 28:).
                    <br><br> 41. Anyone who would have access to the tree of life and the city must be given the right of way. This right is given by the keeping of commandments. (Revelat</p>
