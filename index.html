					<h2>THE WAKE OF A NEW DAWN</h2>

					<img src="/assets/images/what-is-the-burden.png" alt="person walking on a road" />

					<p>
						As humans, we lack wholesomeness and balance that commends us as complete in the sight of God. We’ve all been fed
						and configured in pattern and definition of what life is. This has made us fill up the hole we carry around with a
						limitless number of things we desire and think are call theme our life. The agonies and pains we borne had made and
						driven away independence from family, our past experiences and mistakes have fashioned our decisions and choices.
						And now, we are a shadow of the being God conceived and intended in His mind when He created and formed us in our
						mothers’ womb.
					</p>

					<p>
						Amidst growing chaos, confusion and challenge in the world we live in today, the church cannot play victim nor
						beaten down by overwhelming evil.
					</p>

					<img class="what-is-the-burden--second-img" src="/assets/images/is-faith-a-cliche.png" alt="" />

					<p>
						There is increasing desire in the Body of Christ for the supernatural awakening, great revival and outpouring of the
						Spirit in greater measures in these last times. But we lack clear direction and instruction on how to harness the
						mind of the Spirit and cultivate the victorious life of the same Spirit of Jesus Christ.
					</p>

					<p>
						SMFLX promises to break forth newness of life and spirit; open up fresh founts within you and a new lease of power
						to address various issues plaguing this generation.
					</p>

					<p>
						So we ask, do you desire life? Do you want to be whole as God is? This conference is a must to every individual and
						family; live life in fullness.
