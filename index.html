						<h2><span>What is</span> Single, Married, and Family Life Xperience (SMFLX)</h2>

						<img src="/assets/images/different-hands.png" alt="a family bonding together" />

						<p><span>SMFLX is an acronym for Single, Married, and Family Life Xperience.</span></p>

						<p>
							It is a spiritually-robust platform birthed by the inspiration of the Spirit of God through His servant,
							<span>Pastor Thompson Ehima</span> to facilitate the following:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<span>Preparing singles, married, and families</span> willing and ready to engage the purpose and plan of
								God unto the end.
							</li>

							<li>
								<span>Downloading prerequisite insight, skill, and strength of the knowledge and wisdom of God</span> to
								combat invisible threats to the prosperity of the purpose and plan of God for creation.
							</li>

							<li>
								<span>Raising the banner and standard of the truth</span> in an increasingly dark and gloomy generation of
								singles, married, and families.
							</li>

							<li>
								<span>Giving divine direction and guidance</span> on how to navigate different phases, stages, and seasons
								of life as a single, married, and family.
							</li>

							<li>
								<span>Accessing and discerning prophetic courses</span> playing out in our relationships as single, married,
								and family, lest we miss out on God's ordination.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							The lead conveners are
							<span class="orange-text"> Pastor Thompson Ehima and Pastor (Mrs.) Modupeola Thompson-Ehima, </span> whose
							intense passion for all is to bring clarity and stability in fulfilling God’s original purpose and plan for the
							living.

						<div class="wake-new-dawn--first-content">
							<p>
								As humans, we lack the wholesomeness and balance that commends us as complete in the sight of God. We’ve all
								been fed a false pattern and configured with a negative definition of what life is. This has made us fill up
								the hole we carry around with a limitless number of things we desire, think, and have themed as our life.
								The agonies and pains we have borne have made us stone-like in our relationships and driven away dependence
								on family; our past experiences and mistakes have fashioned our decisions and choices. And now, we are a
								shadow of the being God conceived and intended in His mind when He created and formed us in our mothers’
								wombs.
							</p>

							<p>
								Amidst the growing chaos, confusion, and challenge in the world we live in today, the church cannot play
								victim nor be beaten down by overwhelming evil.
							</p>

						<div class="wake-new-dawn--second-content">
							<p>
								There is an increasing desire in the Body of Christ for a supernatural awakening, great revival, and
								outpouring of the Spirit in greater measures for these last times. But we lack clear direction and
								instruction on how to harness the mind of the Spirit and cultivate the victorious life of the same Spirit of
								Jesus Christ.
							</p>

							<p>
								SMFLX promises to break forth newness of life and spirit, open up fresh founts within you, and a new lease
								of power to address various issues plaguing this generation.
							</p>

							<p>
								So we ask, do you desire life? Do you want to be whole as God is?  This conference is a must for every
								individual and family; to live life in its fullness.
